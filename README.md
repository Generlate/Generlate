### Hi! :grin:

I'm Austen, a programmer :computer:, who is passionate about architecture :house_with_garden:. My interest in machine learning led me to start "[Generlate](https://www.youtube.com/@generlate)", a series of projects exploring generative ai. One day, I want to build machine-generated and managed cities!

 <summary><h3>ðŸ“ƒ My Story</h3></summary>
    Twelve year old Austen had aspirations of producing music. I got really into playing clarinet and saxophone for a ton of different bands. I even made it on Spotify! I'm still nostalgic about those days. Yet, I decided that music was ultimately not for me, six years in. The Philadelphia philharmonic had just gone bankrupt. Plus I was burnt out from overcommitting myself. So, I looked for a new major for college.   <br>The answer I found was architecture. It shared a lot of traits that I enjoyed with music, like creativity and skill. It also had some improvements, like not requiring life-long practice, permanence, less competitive and related to housing. The 2008 housing crash impacted my teenage years a lot and I saw getting into the industry as a way of learning how to prevent any problems for myself. So, I went to Florida International University to become an architect. Now, I was an idiot. I applied late. By the time I did, the program was already full. However, there was a place for me in the landscape architecture program. So, I took it. The classes are the same for the first half of the program anyway. So, I had until the second half to change majors. Fast forward three years, in that time I had designed several buildings. Time to switch majors. Well, that didn't happen. Sustainability was getting really popular around this time, I was told landscape architects make more, it was a hassle to convince the school and knowing the classes, I didn't see the difference. The two majors were very similar. So, I didn't change.    <br>The next three years were a lot of larger design projects and rendering. This is how I got an introduction to GPUs. At the same time, machine learning was growing in notariety. In the program's last year, I was able to do a semester of research. Having a growing interest in technology and its role in augmenting my design process, I researched tech. What I found was the transhumanist movement and a clearer vision of where the world is heading. So, I did what someone with a vision does... I graduated and became a founder    <br> Haha, I understand if that sounds random. Basically, I had encountered a lot of inneficiencies in the design process during school. To my surprise, these were just as bad in professional practice. I realized that the best use of my time wasn't to architect a building but to design the tools architects use. So, I planned out a startup, launched a Youtube channel and studied computer science. I couldn't do all of this immediately because I had to pay off my student loans but I was, eventually, able to take a year off to study MIT's computer science + engineering bachelors. Now, I'm excited to work on design automation and sofware in general.

<!-- - Music
  - 7 years of clarinet and sax
  - many different bands and orchestras
  - on spotify
  - Philadelphia philharmonic went bankrupt + abunch of reasons to change
- Architecture
  - Architecture seemed creative, had a lot of things i liked from music, more stable
  - went to FIU
  - joined APX
  - building projects
  - I had until the second half of the program to change into main architecture
  - little difference between the programs
  - sustainability was popular and LA pay was better
- Landscape Architecture
  - A lot of district scale projects
  - got into transhumanism
  - decided to get into tech to achieve the impact i want (change the architecture industry)
  - frustration at how slow processes are and school in general
  - machine learning is becoming more impactful
  - i had a some familiarity with GPUs now through rendering
  - i really didn't like the work experience. very different from school, culture sucks
  - graduated
- Computer Science
  - started my youtube channel
  - planned a startup (startup FIU)
  - pay is too low
  - worked in landscape architecture while learning computer science
  - took a year off to study through MIT (faster learning, took all of the undegraduate classes and read the books)
  - did some projects
  - took algoexpert -->
